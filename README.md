# Temp workaround for `Cannot read property 'version' of null` [Issue #192](https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service/issues/192):

Replace the contents of the server folder in your vscode Angular.ng-template-0.1.7 extension with the files out of the repo:

https://github.com/smasala/angular-language-service-0.17.patch

You'll usually find your extension folder in Windows under:
C:\Users[username].vscode\extensions\Angular.ng-template-0.1.7
